# CS481_Final_Project
Final for CPCS 481: Snake AI game, our final project implements a Snake artificial intelligence agent using Pygame and neural networks, employing reinforcement learning to optimize its performance through interactive gameplay experiences. The agent trains to pick up apple items, and avoid collisions.

# This Python code implements a neural network-based artificial intelligence for playing the Snake game.

To run follow steps below:

1. Download files to a local machine.
2. (If using anaconda to run virtual enviroments) Use the virtual enviroment "CS481_Final_Project_env" provided in the project files.)
3. Run in python version 3.10 or higher with command "python CS481FinalProject"
4. Let the model train for 1 minute or 100 games (the game is set to 1000fps speed for training so user does not have to a long time for model to train, *** The speed is set to 20fps for after 100+ games for viewing ***)

# A gif below is provided to demonstrate the agents behaviour after 100 games.
